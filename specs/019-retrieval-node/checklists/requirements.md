# Specification Quality Checklist: Retrieval Step

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-11-05): Removed storage-engine wording from Assumptions so the spec stays on the designer-visible search outcome.
- Validation iteration 2 (2026-11-05): All items pass.
- The step searches existing organization semantic memory and does not create a new memory product (Assumptions, FR-007, FR-011).
- Cross-organization denial is a release gate (FR-008, SC-002, SC-005).
