# Specification Quality Checklist: Delete Workflow Button

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-10-04): All items pass. Spec stays at user/business level (Delete control, confirmation, ownership, list updates, navigation after delete). Assumptions document permanent delete, owner-only permission, UI placement, and out-of-scope bulk/restore.
- No post-specify extension hooks registered (`.specify/extensions.yml` absent).
